> So where can we find a village? We have many co-parents helping to raise our children: our parents, friends and family members. Some are regular and consistant fixtures in the daily lives of our family while others are around for just birthdays or holiday times. All in all we are happy with our village. Moving into school and kinder next year, Felix and Tilda will have more co-parents in their lives.  
> Both the kinder and prep teachers are wonderful women with a depth of experience in both life and teaching and still a passion for children and their learning. The comfort I derive is enriching, I already feel at ease and comfortable with these women to speak about and express our wishes for our family. We are able to be ourselves and do not stand out to be particularly different and yet there is a celebration about the unique qualities that we and Felix and Tilda bring to the school community. It is a wonderful feeling to breathe fresh air in the place where we send our children to play and learn.
