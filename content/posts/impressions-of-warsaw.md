We fly into Warsaw with the sun shining- a radical difference to wet cloudy London. Jumpers were quickly removed as we walked out of the aeroplane onto the tarmak. I think Felix and Matilda were relieved to only be on the airplane for 2.5 hrs rather than the 2 they had experienced 10 days earlier. Lech met us at the arrivals area and hailed a min-van taxi to take us to our accomadation. I forgot they drive on the RHS of the road. It feels a little back-to-front for the first 2 km. Warsaw is hot, sunny and in the thick of summer splendar a stark contrast to the Febuary 3003 experience last time.
