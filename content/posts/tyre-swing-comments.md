#### I too wish for him to relive some of my childhood ...

I too wish for him to relive some of my childhood memories, like the time we camped out on a beach in Kuwait and saw a scorpion, or how I ran around the house with a band of my friends on my 6th birthday each of us armed with battery operated machine guns; mine even had a plastic bronze like cylinder that would kick out to give the impressions of shells flicking out, or the time when I ate so much chocolate at Easter that all I could do was sit on the couch. I hope as a parent I am still able to allow some of these less desirable but just as memorable times.
