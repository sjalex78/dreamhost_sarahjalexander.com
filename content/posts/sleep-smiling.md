A mother wants to be noticed even if only for that smile. A week old Ambrose is growing really fast and I have nicknamed hime "milk-pig". A small tongue tye has not stopped him from getting enough milk to gain 400g in 4 days! After filling his tummy he will fall asleep in my arms and I sit and gaze at him for a wonderful smile. What is he dreaming about? Aaaah not the real deal yet but what a wonderful sight I look forward to having one shot my way.
