Don't worry, I get ahead of myself all the time. I made the mistake of showing Sabina a couple of DVD's, which start off well, but then were obviously inappropriate for her. Luckily we always have Thomas and Bob to come back to.  
  
And, on the repetition bit. We seem to be constantly "on the bus". Initially it was just a couple of chairs one behind the other. Now it's the chairs, plus you need a ticket before you can sit down. Wonder what will be next?
