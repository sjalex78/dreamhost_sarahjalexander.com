Aaaah depression a world you can not use with some people but thankfully my husband and friends it is a conversation we can openly have. I like every human naturally swing with moods. Some days are great others a little plain and some dark. Very normal but throw in a baby and normal can feel like a 1000 miles away.  
What I think makes it hardest is the lack of acknowledgement from some people. You know the ones who only have time for you when success triumph good times are abundant.  
  
I love to share my ups and downs and are thankful that a network of friends family and the community I live have helped to hold me during these first few months of my babies life.
