I can't believe it is 7 months today that Felix was born. About time to put his birth story in writing! My EDD had come and gone and I was 12 days over due, very uncomfortable and very ready to give birth. Saturday morning 4am(7/8/04) I went to the toilet and went back to bed and had a contraction. In the nights preceding this one I had had a few contraction each night around the same time. Usually after around 3 they would stop. But today was finally the day. After around 5 contractions I woke up Michael to tell him! I couldn't sleep I was so excited and relieved. I had been booked in to be induced for the coming Tues morning! at 5:30am I rang my mum to let her know that things would be happening today and that we would call when it nearly time to go to hospital.  
  
After a little breakfast at 7am Michael started to recorded when the contractions were happening- they were 5 minutes apart but no too strong. I wanted to get some fresh air so we walked the two dogs (Asparagus & Zucchini) to the park and arrived home a few hours later. I found the contraction would stop me walking for a few moments- but I felt great otherwise. I rang the Birthing Centre to let them know that I was in the early part of labour and that we would ring later in the day.  
  
The day seemed to drag on and we played cards, ate and read with contractions every 5 minutes! At around 4 pm- 12 hours after the first contraction my mum rang and during the conversation I have a particularly bad contraction. Having her voice at the end of the line made me a little emotional and I started to cry- so she decided to come over (she was around 1 hour away). When mum arrived - 1 hour later- I was pacing around the house during contractions and did not ANYONE near me. During the breaks I was happily chatting and trying the eat. Michael decided to go for a walk and get the dogs tired as we where in for a big night.  
  
At 5:30pm I got into the bath and for the next hour was having contractions every 5minutes  
and trying to sleep in between. When Michael returned from his walk we rang the birth  
centre. They want to speak to me but I was suddenly having contraction back to back. One would stop I would breath in and the next one was starting again. I think Michael was getting a little nervous and decided that we should get to the hospital. The next 1/2 hour was such a blur- you would think that being 12 days over I would be packed but No- last minute items were thrown into our bag- "where is the birth plan Sarah?" "I don't Carrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre!" I had several contractions on the freeway and felt as if I was on a roller coaster.  
  
When we pulled up in front of the hospital approx 9pm- I got really worried about what other people would think of me! Lets just say I had no contractions from the car to the birthing centre- my body just stopped. The minute I was in my room BINGO we started again! I just could get comfortable. I just wanted to get back into a bath.A bath was ran for me and Michael and I hopped it- Oh what relief! Michael held my head above the water for the next 3 hours. I would fall totally asleep between contraction and had dreams! At around 11:30pm I had some really really painful contractions so Michael suggested that gas might help me. It did. It was not that the pain was not there but that I didn't mind the pain.  
  
I started to push- no-one said to and I had not control. The midwife did an internal and tried to tell me not to push! She said to puff instead as I was not fully dilated. COME ON. I tried for 1 contractions but there was not way I could control my body it just wanted to push. 1/2 hour later the midwife says "Sarah you are going to have you baby in the next 10 minutes" I couldn't believe it.  
  
So I pushed! Michael held me up in the bath and Mum held the Dolphin torch for the midwife so she could see under the water. 10 minutes later Felix was born in the bath. He was put on my stomach and I just kept saying "Hello" "Your Perfect!".  
  
Felix was born at 12:57am 08/08/2004 and weighted 4.66kg (10pound 4 1/2 oz).  
  
  
Thanks for letting me share my experiences.
