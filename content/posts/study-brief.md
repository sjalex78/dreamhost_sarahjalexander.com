Plan so Far:

To build a long desk 4300mm by 450mm along the wall under the window. Install wall cupboard units above the window. Paint walls. Reseal floor. Door installation. Wallpaper feature wall with matching inlay to cupboards. Blinds. Office seats to suit children and adults.

  

  

  

**The desk:**

We have requested quotes for two desks so far. First is using a recycled timber desk top made to our dimensions by a local company and for us to attach desk legs. This is perhaps the cheaper choice however it appears that the leg design at our disposal are limited with the desk being so narrow. We wan to have a table leg which limited the obstruction of your legs such as this one:

  

We have also asked for a quote at [http://www.industriax.com.au/](http://www.industriax.com.au/) who construct the table with steel frame, incorporating a C box leg in the middle and sustainable ash timber strained in the colour of our choice. This company can also make us matching study chairs and stools at our height specification to suit our multi age usage. We can have the steel any colour within the powder-coat range all 86 of them.

  

**Colour:**

We want to room to promote a mood to creativity and focus for both children and adults a like. The wall paper will be a green base while the rest of the room will be painted a seed pearl white.

  

**Storage:**

Using a range of kitchen cupboards to utilise the space to a maximum.
