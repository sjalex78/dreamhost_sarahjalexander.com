We are heading into the final weeks of my final pregnancy. I have three very excited children and a niece who is busting to meet her new cousin! This week we made a baby picture board. It consists of the children's favourite new born pictures of themselves, image of Michael and I as newborns. And a story board of ideas of what to expect. The older children (&maybe Mr2 yr old) will hopefully be apart of the birth if all is well. Building this picture board was a wonderful experience and allowed us to reflect and be joyous about this pregnancy, a rare commodity during this pregnancy! My niece has also been amazing at lifting my sprits. I see her once or twice every week and am meet with the warmest hug, belly kiss and questions of when is baby coming. I have been made to promise to let her know the moment the baby arrive so she (miss5) can visit and have a cuddle. Our interactions make me excited about our babies arrival every time. When where and how this baby enters earth side will be disclosed to us all soon.Â
