Giggles of delight are heard from behind. I pass another handful of organic wild blackberries over my shoulder. The berries are quickly grabbed and shoveled into Matilda's mouth. I push through the rapid upstream to the next blackberry bush. Matilda impatiently taps me on the shoulder, grunts for more and becomes annoyed as I leave blackberries behind. The blackberries taunt us- so ready to be picked but so high and unachievable to pick. Matilda's face and hands are covered in deep purple blackberry juice when I put her down from the carrier.
