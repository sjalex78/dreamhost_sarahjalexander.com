Wow, a activity poster ... what a great idea. Must do one with Sabina. It will give me an excuse to use those paints I bought for her.  
  
As for your last dilemma ... Felix obviously needs to come and ride the pony again! And the pony needs riding too (very fat). Speaking of which, Mum & Dad want to come up to farm, and they would really really like to bring Felix along as well. Please consider.
