What better way than to start the holidays than to acquire a piece of equipment that can generate freedom. With a 12.8kg old school steel bike, Felix has found riding a chore rather than the freedom to move, accelerate and weave. So we hit the bike shop in search for the [BYK.](http://www.bykbikes.com/kids-bike-range/e450-kids-bike)  
Felix undertook a test ride and had a wide excited smile, he was in love, while I thought he looked so comfortable so my mind was made up.  
After a ride home (I could hardly keep up with the new machine and its boy) we heading out country to play with Sabina and burn a bonny. Heavy rain and two widely excited dogs greet us on our return. Day 1 of the holidays is over.
