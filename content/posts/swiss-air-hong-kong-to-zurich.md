14 hours of flying ahead. The seats have more room to stretch my legs then the previous flight. After a quick supper the whole plane went to sleep. The kids also got a bit of a snooze, Matilda lying on top of me for 4 hours, slowly sliding down my chest, my back uncomfortable, seat not reclining enough, every 20 minutes I wake up to reposition her.  
  
As the plane wakes up the kids also get up and are in a good mood. They make up a song singing "make potato" over and over and over again.
