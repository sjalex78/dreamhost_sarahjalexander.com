The Indian prince will be missing his front teeth. This week has been manic with rehearsals almost every day for Felix's upcoming ballet performance. We have also taken turns in having a really bad cough and cold(Ambrose worst of all). But here we are hours from the ballet concert really to see the months of practice coming to fruition. Last weekend Felix lost a top front tooth which started a week of tooth lost. Tuesday at school a bottom front came out and finally this morning another front top tooth came away. Our little prince is gap ridden for the concert.
