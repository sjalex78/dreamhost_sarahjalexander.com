My inner child wants beautiful objects for my children. I feel a sense of peace when I enter a play space that does not use cheap plastic toys that spoil the beauty of the space let alone the enveloped warmth of play. An old basket catches my attention- it has history, it has a thousand uses- not limited by a materialist driven toy business. A boat, an island, a bed, storage for play clothes, my mind has been limited but my children will find 100 more uses. It is ours. A welcome addition to our beautiful play room- a haven for the child at heart.
