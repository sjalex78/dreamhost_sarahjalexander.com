We arrive at our bush camp site at 10pm. Zucchini and Gus jump out the car and run through the bush until 1am when they return and fall asleep in the tent. Morning sunrise and the dogs continue their bush adventure. Zucchini flips from front to back paws and back again like a cartwheel. We all laugh. She does it again. From the next 2 hours she flip flops. "I love bush camping" Zucchini says.
