Hey what time is it? Who cares? Sorry a little rant and rave. It seems to me that time rules the world at the moment.  
Time to start school. Time to be there and there and for this long. Time to have that a baby out. Time to retire. Time to grow up. My memory of childhood was timeless and I thank my parents for never proactively teaching me the time. The only time I knew of was bedtime 8:30. But 8:30 really meant some time after A Country Practice finished on Television which came after brushing our teeth, having a bath putting on the pajamas, eating dinner, playing and coming home from school.  
I was watch less (timeless) until I started high school. A small family tradition (we only have a few!) has occurred for 3 generations and I hope for the next too. Your maternal grandparents give you at watch on your 12th Birthday and this is what I experienced and want my children to have too. A timeless 12 years. No time accountability, let the adults in their life take the responsibility. Being 12 usually marks the start of high school and an era in your life of real time responsibility. Catching the bus to school, taking yourself to basketball practice or meeting friends at the cinema.So yes a wrist watch makes sense.  
Ok so I cringe when I see a 5 year old being trained to read the time from their watch, what I experienced last night and I blog to release my grrrr. A watch is like a a shackle, a way to control and make a child somehow accountable. Hey Felix and Matilda what time is it? :)
