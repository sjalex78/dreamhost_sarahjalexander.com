I have a forebear who have had 21 children but as a modern women I will not be trying to match her family composition. I have the fortune to have at least 15 months of amenorrhea after the birth of each child. As I come to the end of my child bearing years i feel pangs of closure which I will be reminded of monthly until my 50's. I am note sure how I will transition to this new phase but a celebration and mourning it will be. Although the modern women does not bear children from teenage to late 40's as my grandmothers of eras before did there is still the instinctual emotional and burning desire which can be found within.
