Only weeks of Felix starting Steiner Kinder, an alternative kinder environment which nurtures the sprite of children and treats them with reverence and I have a reality check. "Shit I can't do this" Felix stated a he threads beads to make a bracelet. I shuddered- I hear my bad language thrown at me. It is time for me to start to realise that those ears are listening all the time- thank goodness every second statement I do hear from him is "I love you Mama". It seems I might be saying somethings right after all.
