Gracie is seven and a half months old. She has been crawling for the last week to ten days after a month or so of commando. She has also started to eat family foods for the last 8 weeks and now eats whatever is on offer. Gracie has adjusted so well to the hectic life of being the forth born and brings such happiness to us all. Her bond with each sibling is loving strong and so unique. She laughs for Felix, waits to be picked up by Tilda and watches Ambrose with strong intensity. Once a week her grandfather ares for her and there is such a lovely connection growing between them. She also attends crèche once a week when I work my second day. I am still popping home to feed her once a day which is a very special moment in my otherwise fast paced work day.
