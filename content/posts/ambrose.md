Energy intensity go go. Ambrose is three years 3 months. This year he has adjusted well as a big brother, changed to kinder and toilet trained which such amazing fluidity. He does struggle accepting help from older siblings and when over tired bounces even harder and higher. Four weeks ago he started Steiner kinder only a week after toilet training. He wanted to go to the new kinder which required undies rather than nappies so that is just what he did! Ambrose continues to breastfeed here and there but his intensity about is slowly abating. He currently shares a room with Felix but has a parent with him at night when scared or worried.
