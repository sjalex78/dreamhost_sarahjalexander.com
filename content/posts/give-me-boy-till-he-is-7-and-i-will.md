My first baby is 7 (&1/4)very important to remember that when you are 7! Gaps in his mouth are quickly filling with adult teeth. I am starting to really struggle when we wrestle. He is starting to be better at things like ballet and piano than I ever have been. We are heading towards making decisions in his life that might change his options in the future. Singing or ballet or both.  
But what is lovely to see is that the attachment parenting we decided to undetake 7 years ago has helped to create an independent emotionally balanced 7 year old boy who has many friends of all ages and a stunning confidence and optimism that will see that His future will be dynamic and what he wants it to be.  
I look forward to seeing this 7 year old becoming a wonderful man.
