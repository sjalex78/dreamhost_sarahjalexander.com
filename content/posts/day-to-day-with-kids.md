The other day Sarah was observing how Felix was interacting with other kids playing at a playground. Joshua and Inga were chasing around the playground on some paving. Felix joined in but seemed to have missed the minor detail of following the paving. Paving turned left and Felix went on ahead into the sunset screaming with joy, hands waving like a butterfly, having a ball, not even registering that the other kids were no longer following him.

  

Later that same day Felix took a book out onto a deck to have a read in the sunshine. Not our book and not our deck so Sarah was worried that he may come into a bit of "No" parenting. No! a book is an indoor item, No! do not take it outside, and so on. Ahh to take a book out onto a deck in a sunny spot and just read, I would love to do that.
