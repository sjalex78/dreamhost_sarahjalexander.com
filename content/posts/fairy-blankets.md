I hand Felix a new scrap book. "Has it got fairy blankets" he enthusiastically exclaims. My mind darts around lost for a microsecond and I respond "no sorry not this on". He seems unfazed and merrily open the new scrap book and starts his "school" work. Michael looks at me and asks "what are fairy blankets?" "Ahh you are not a Steiner kid! The tissue paper between drawing paper in main lesson books from school", I respond.
