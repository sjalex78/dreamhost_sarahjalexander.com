Tilda is growing with confidence by the day. He bright bubbly personality captures people's attentions where ever we go. She is universally appealing cute and attractive. She is hard to live with at her understanding of what she wants outstrips her level of communications thus we have emotional outbursts on a daily occurrance. Everything is MINE MINE MINE. We am positive that this obsession with object will pass as she matures and i hope for her sake that objects will not be the central focus in the years to come. With her interpersonal skills obviously highly developed for 22 months I think she will be ok.
