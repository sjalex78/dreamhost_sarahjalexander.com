Felix loves to dance and has started Polonez (polish dancing).  
Tonight I watched him and enjoyed seeing him:  
\*look at himself in the mirror with complete admiration  
\*dob on the "boys" who would not line up like the girls  
\*almost burst into tears because he thought the boys had to chop up the girls, when in fact the girls were pretending to be wheat  
  
He doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the group yet (the next boy is at least 8) but with a combination of self confidence, being young at heart and loving dance he is openly accepted by all, even when he leaves rehearsal pretending to be a dog!
