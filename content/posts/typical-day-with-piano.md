So we finally got a piano. I was very sceptical at first, the expense, the size and the fact that no one in the household knows how to use it. My only leap of faith for the present was that I learn how to type, I learned to control all of the fingers of my right and left hand, If I did that, learning to play the piano is just the next logical step in the same direction.  
  
There is the bigger fact that we used educational funds for our children to purchase the piano. The piano is really for them. I look forward to singing their nursery rhymes along with the piano. Then their first lessons. Then hopefully a great skill, personal development and great enjoyment.  
  
So now that we have a piano, how is life different. Actually I think life is different because Sarah has a job. On Thursday's and Friday's the kids are dropped off in creche and Sarah works at the water studies lab. Work is pretty drab, doing experiments and analysis for outside customers but it suits perfectly. It is easy for her to disconnect from the job, she is just down the road so she can go out and feed Matilda, and there are some procedure optimisations in the lab that Sarah already has her eye on.  
  
So the job started a couple of weeks ago and at a similar time so did Sarah's regular washing of dishes after dinner. I usually do not even notice as she collects dishes, washes and rinses, wipes down bench tops, everything is ready for the next day. I swear I have been promoting this kind of order for years and finally I have it, wonderful.  
  
The rest of the day fits around this as only it can. Wednesday night dishes, lights out everyone is in bed. Thursday morning is bike ride for me so alarm at 5:00 am and I am out by 5:30 am. Sarah has the radio come on at 5:45 and by quarter past six the kids are up. Half past Sarah has an alarm to make sure she is up.  
  
I presume that Matilda at this time is like a dream, all smiles, crawling around and happy. Felix no doubt sneaks in a 5 minute whinge about "nana" which he gets but at designated times. Sarah loves feeding Felix from the breast but she can only do so much if he asks non stop, and in such a whinge.  
  
The rest I presume also runs like clock work, creche bags are ready, kids get dressed, breaky and they are at uni by half past seven. Wow this is the Sarah that I used to know. I always knew she needs some time guidance and work is best. She also seems to have found some guidance in being more open in her sexuality.  
  
The day is full of frantic calls from me to see what she is up to unfortunately  
they are all futile as her phone has discharged. I get a reminder call at five that it is time to go. I get home at six and see that they are all there, a little bit tired from their days. By now it is usually couch time with a book and imagination is low. I do not even get a chance to get changed and it is time  
to put dinner on the table. I feed Matilda and on the side eat a whole half  
cantaloupe. Again I over ate for lunch so I am trying to under compensate.  
  
I look at the piano, it says play me now. I can not wait to put my fingers on the keys. Strike down hard and here the sound, then try to play as quietly as I can. "Michael you clean up and I will bath with the kids" OK, I do not mind washing dishes. So I clear the table, try and wipe the food of the table cover  
from the last week, give the kids chairs a once over and get started on sweeping the floor. I have not even started with the washing and Sarah is already saying that she is planning on finishing up in the bath. I hurry, it is crucial I do not get distracted. If the kids get out I may need to stop and help Sarah, that could mean not finishing the dishes and getting told off by Sarah tomorrow. It may make her late for work.  
  
I firmly say "No". I keep washing trying to make sure I finish. Some harder oven trays and the electric grill which the dogs have already licked clean. I am done. Sarah and the kids are also out but some how I was not required at the other end of the house. Now for the piano.  
  
I go and play a little. Soon there is Felix looking for someone to play with and Sarah trying to read a book in bed where Tilda is happily crawling around on the bed no where near ready for sleep. I decide that this is ridiculous and invite everyone into the living room. I get back to the piano and everyone else seems satisfied for a while. Felix wants to join me. No he wants to have exclusive access to the piano, typical Felix. I get a dining table chair but he is not impressed. Sarah joins us an tries to teach him chop sticks.  
  
I tell her that in only 3 sessions I am already playing things with both hands. Sarah agrees and tries out some pieces. I encourage her to start at the start of the book. No I tell her. I think this is so easy if you just follow the steps. I start to wonder how far I could have got if I started this as a kid. If only I had the foresight of following steps when I was a kid. Anyway, this allows me to feel like a kid right here right now. I hope I have other child like dreams saved up for future decades.  
  
Sarah gets through a few exercises and invites me to play some more. No she will recite a book about a cat, cousin of hairy McLairy I think. Tilda cannot take it anymore, she is tired, screams, I pick her up, put her in an ergo carrier, start pacing around the dark rooms of the house. I feel sorry for Sarah, she wants to read the story to do the best for the kids, but Tilda's tiredness breaks the family bond, I am distracted.  
  
I am back on the piano. Tilda on my back. Soon Sarah and Felix go to bed, I run through all my pieces again. Good timing. Sarah is in bed before nine again. I thought she should do some programming, I am planning for her to learn Ruby, MySQL and Rails to build a web app to serve as a contacts database for the toy library. It is good she is in bed, tomorrow will work out for her. She runs in the morning, I get the kids ready. Hopefully I will wake first and get some time in on the piano. I have also a bike race to get ready for, clothes, food, not forgetting my helmet.  
  
I like typing on my laptop, now with a new battery. I have it on my lap simply to highlight I have no cords attached, it is battery powered again. The previous  
battery had died down to only thirty seconds of charge. The laptop is old but still serves the purpose as a type writer. Type writer, I have one of those, I just need a ribbon, I like typing on it. Ahh but most of all I want to play the piano.  
  
good night.
