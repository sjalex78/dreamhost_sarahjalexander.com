There are four wonderful individuals in our lives who are so important in helping our children grow. We are lucky to have such different and unique grandparents. Grandparents are like a gap filler they have the characteristics of your children which you may not have yourself. They live without you needing to make your children lovable. You do not need to defend your children and who they are. I thank our parents for being so different. Maternal grandmother for the witty naughty fun filled lying in the bed evenings when bodily functions can be laughed at. A paternal grandmother who gobbles you up with warm loving hugs and always fills your tummy with love (via chicken soup). Paternal grandfather who fills the minds of the young with stories and pictures and who has the patients needed by strong minded children. A maternal grandfather who us not afraid to be who he is and does not hide his mental illness out of fear of rejection and in doing so demonstrates to his grandchildren an openess so desirable and benefical for emotional growth. I might find it frustrating that the care of my children is not done the way I would do it but really the thankful and glad of it for the benefactors are my children and their growth and happiness.
