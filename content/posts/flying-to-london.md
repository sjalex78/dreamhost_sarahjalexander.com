When you discover your child is scared of heights- it is best not to sit them at the window seat of an international flight- we discovered this at flight #3 23 hours into traveling to London. One word meltdown.  
  
Sleep deprived parents and children, security mad airports and line and lines of people. But I am proud to say we did ok. We managed only to argue in Hong Kong but still loved each other when boarding the next flight.  
  
Felix and Matilda might still be happy to get on a airplane again.  
  
Hello London.
