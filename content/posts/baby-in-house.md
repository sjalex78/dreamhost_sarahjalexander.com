Felix and Matilda were instantly in love when they set eyes on Ambrose. I have etched into my memory the sight of their excited faces as they stepping into my room at the birth center. They discovered he was a boy when changing his nappy and giggle with pure delight "it's a boy". It has been a wonderful journey to share with them and to see how they light up when they cuddle and hold him has made a difficult pregnacy all worth it.
