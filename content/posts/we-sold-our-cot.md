We purchased a cot 3 1/2 years ago. I was pregnant and like most of us being bombard by this notion that I need this and that for our baby. High on the list was a cot. So we brought the cot home place it in the "babies room" and started to create the nursary! I am so relieved now that I found information about the natural rythums and rightfull sleep place of babies when I was 7 months pregnant. I remember reading that children who sleep in close proximity to their parents have their temperature regulated, can feed when their bodies tell them it is time too and do not fall into deep sleep which can increase the risk of COT death. On the negative side there is the risk of rolling onto you baby and apparently people feel you will "spoil" your child. Armed with this new founded information I talked about sharing our bed with Michael. Michael is truely a natural parent at heart. While I battle with my upbringing, "what other people think and not wanting to be different, Michael naturally knows what is best for his children.  
  
Upon bring Felix home I place him in the cot the first night we arrived home. I lay in bed- It felt all wrong. I had spent 5 days in hospital with him in my bed the entire time. I had had him inside my body for 10 months and now I was going to put him a bed that looks more like a cage. 10 mins later he was in our bed and has slept there ever since. So now I have 2 children and a cot which has been used for 10 minutes. I finally listed it on ebay last week and the cot has been sold. Perhaps our cot will again stand unused in it's new home. What I hope most of all that the cot never hears the sad cries of a child abandonded by its mindless parents in the hope it will learn to sleep (that is a whole other issue!).  
  
So as you can guess I am pro co-sleeping but most of all I am choice and for parents to understand why their children need them at night. I get really cross when parents suggesting that their baby is manipulating them!
