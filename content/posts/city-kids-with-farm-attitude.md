While other children are panicked by the site of a dog, Felix and Matilda are completely confident and comfortable with Gus- our German Shorthaired Pointer. The confidence they derive from living with a dog I believe translates to their confidence at "our farm". Felix believes that the Collingwood Children Farm is our farm- and for only $90 a year for membership it is a lot cheaper than the real thing. We are also fortunate to have my parent's Mt.Martha place with sheep, and also Alex and Little Alex the two horses who love to eat carrots and bite each other.
