As we got off the plane we had only 1 hour to find out where we are transferring to and sorting out boarding passes, as well as the walking at the pace of a 21 month old, and the whims of a 3.5 year old not wanting to walk on a travelator, as well as a bit of a language barrier with the airport staff thrown in for good measure.  
  
Everyone from the airport staff seemed to tell us to go UP. Up to the transfer desk at gate 61 (which did not exist), up the stairs to the airline desk (which ended up being down) and finally a janitor in the dunnies, that convinced me to swap my $AUD 5 for Â£ 2, said to go to a level 7 cafe to get some drinking water as the water fountain was closed for maintenance.  
  
4 boarding passes all the way through to London, everything seemed to have gone right again.
