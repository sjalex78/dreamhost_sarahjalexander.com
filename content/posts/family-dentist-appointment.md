Felix, Tilda and I ride the bus to the dentist. Felix is experienced and walks in with a sense of confidence, " I know all about the dentist" he announces to the receptionist, "I have been in the chair before. Tilda is quiet and is taking it all in, this is her first visit.  
  
Felix egerly jumps int he chair and dons the sunglasses. 5 minute after a quick too the dentist is satisfied, " they look good" Phew I thought, we are a little relaxed with brushing teeth, although we had brushed them before we came.  
  
It was now Tilda's turn.  
  
She stared at the dentist with obvious judgment. Even the dentist recognised the suspisious look of a strong minded 3 year old. "I want to go in the chair" Tilda asserted. Without eye contact she sat in the chair. The dentist suggested that she open her mouth. Tilda ignored this request and continued to avoid looking at the dentist. 2 minutes in the chair and half a dozen request to open her mouth from the dentist Felix and I, Tilda decided that her go was over and promptly jumped out the chair and told me " it's your turn now...  
  
My turn was involved 2 minutes of examination and the dentist gave me a clean bill of dental health, no fillings yet! We jumped on the bus to travel home and enjoyed some donuts with sugar on top!
