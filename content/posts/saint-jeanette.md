We wake up to the warm buzz of summer. We are staying in a modern day cave in the hills high above Nice, France. Saint Jeanette is the home for Michael's Aunt Ginette and Uncle Joseph Milewski. We are instantly made to feel at home. We have fortunately timed our visit to meet with Paul, Ginette and Joseph's son, and his family. Felix is instantly playing Areanne (almost 5) and they are inseparable until exhaustion beckons then to bed each night. Each day we are spoil with local wine, cheese and fresh produces and spectacle view of Southern France.
