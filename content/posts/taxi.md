The day started with jumping in a taxi and ended played with a taxi. We have finally departed from Warsaw- a sense of relief. It is abundantly clear that inner city apartment living is not good for our family dynamics. After hopping into a taxi (just ask Michael about this :)) and via rail we travel north to Wloclawek to meet with Michael's family. A lovely couple Ella and Wlowek who have a backyard as big as ours. To our collective delight we are also introduced to a 2 year old chocolate labrador TAXI who reminds us of who we have left at home :(. She is beautiful and after a relaxed afternoon and evening Michael and I agree that we really love living with "dog" people they (we) are really a different breed, happy to go with the flow!
