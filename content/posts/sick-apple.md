Apple is not well. She is currently sitting in the guinea pig hutch recovering. No water or food will pass her beak unless I syring feed her (more like shove it down her throat and force her crop to fill up). Not sure how she will be and have braced the children for the event of her dying. Day 4 today she is still alert and better than day 2 when I had asked Michael to put her down (he decided to wait- thank goodness). Cross fingers that she is better soon....
