The New Year has begun and we take an "easy" holiday period ito prepare for the busy year that 2015 is likely to be.

  

 Gracie has recently returned to creche after a months break and is a joy to her carers as she toddles confidently about the center and is very social to children and adults alike. She is also so very confident around water which has promped me to book her into swimming lessons. 

  

Ambrose has begun the kinder year at a steiner kinder and depending on his confidence he may be ther for 2015 and 2016 before heading to school. Ambrose is very independent but also incredibly sensitive and hense finding transisitons particularly around our work commitments challenging. When comfortable with his surroundings he is entirely at ease the idea of swim lessons is horrendous but upon starting he is a fish in water. 

  

Matilda has settled after a big 2014 year. She shared a lovely morning tea with her teacher at home which has given her a huge confidence in school boost and I must say we have some of the most dedicated teachers I have ever heard of! She will continue to swim, play viola, dance ballet and take part in scouts for 2015 as well as being a tremendous  big sister who is so patient and such a good "teacher".

  

Felix is dedicated to ballet as well as his music studies continuing with cello and adding piano to his "load". He is a pasionate student and guess what?????? He reads!! He now sets his clock to 5:30am so he can get an hour of two of his current novel Eragon. We had to ban him taking his book to scout camp recently as it was likely he would rea his book in preference to sleep;)

  

Michael has recently changed work and is finding it amazingly inspirational. He is also a dedecated scout leader, pens new songs for a number of "birthday" celebrations and will reach an age milestone for 2015. 

  

I am continuing to teach at an inspirational independant school and will be taking a VCE Chemistry class. This will be in balance with family, sport and hoping to write a book during the 2015 year.

  

As a family we head off to Bright for our annual camping trip and hope to ride fish and bond for the Australia Day weekend before school blasts off for 2015.....
