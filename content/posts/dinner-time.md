Matilda won the competition and chose where we were to eat. Denn at Westgarth we go. A disavantage to confident children they don't understand the table booking system. They march past the waiter and straight to their favourite table occupied by 2 of the 6 party. I found them happily talking to these people who look somewhat bemused. Fortunately there is one table left and a reasonable consolation prize it is up stairs!!!
