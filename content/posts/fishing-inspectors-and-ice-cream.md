The bike zoomed down the hill towards the waiting lake. Briskly walking, I tried to keep up. Other children tried to catch fish into the shallows, A fish covered car captures our interest as fishermen are booked from illegal catches. Matilda just tried to stay upright. One icecream is never enough and devastation reigns when it is discovered that there is none of Matilda's left for a try. We head back up the hill- slowly until the homeward hill where Felix is gone in a cloud of dust.
