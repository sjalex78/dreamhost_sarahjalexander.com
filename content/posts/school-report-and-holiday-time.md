Having studied VEL's ([http://vels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/](http://vels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/))during my Dip-Ed and using them report on my students last year I find it amusing to see my own child's school report. As a parent you instinctively know (or hopefully do) the personality, learning type and intelligence of your child. But does his/her teacher? In the Steiner system (state and private) children have the same teacher from class 1-8. Some schools will do a split (1-3/4, 4/5-8) if a teacher has a particular strength of understanding for junior or middle school years. SO at the start of this year when introduced to Felix's teacher I naturally sussed her out. I felt reassured by her academic understanding and found she was more math confident than most primary school teachers which was refreshing. She was honest and did not presume to know everything but her openness to learn was outstanding. I have always believed that learning how to learn is a skill children need to see for themselves through experience and example.  
But would this new teacher really understanding Felix?  
His school report has expressed Felix perfectly. A team leader, confident, a wild imagination which is contagious, puts in 100% effort and wonderful behaviour. Felix's VEL's levels at at the standard or above the standard required for a year 1 student. This is Felix to a tee. Felix is my "easy" go lucky child. My Matilda on the other hand is hard work but her character is wonderful. She is tenacious, strong and more intelligent academically than me (& Felix). This for a 4 year old can be hard work to keep your emotions and self in check socially. She reminds me so much of my brother who unfortunately had a rocky time at school and I know that the sussing out of her teachers in the years to come will be incredibly important to ensure that she is guided and not squeezed into conforming with school. My confidence in the school is strong for the primary school years and our plan is for the children to move into other schools at class 5, 7 or 9 level depending on their needs. Now for some school holiday adventures to enrich imagination, refuel the bodies and bond as family unit once again.
