Michael took Felix and Matilda to a local zoo where Felix was able to feed Marmots and watch bears frolic in a swimming pool. Meanwhile I set off to be a tourist for the afternoon and heading to Lourdes. It is the Jubilee years of a image of Mary coinciding with a flow of a spring. Many people come to Lourdes to seek the healing qualities of the holy water from the spring. There were many people on pilgrimage to Lourdes. As I wanted toward the church I was stuck by how commercial it all was. You could purchase jerry cans to fill with Holy water. As we are rapidly reaching our luggage limits I decided that maybe next time I might get a Jerry can.
