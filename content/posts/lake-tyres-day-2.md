Sarah found burning a pile of timber extremely therapeutic\- why does the destruction of something ease the mind.  
  
Matilda squealed with delight as she practices standing and would happily tumble down.  
  
Felix helped to bake Thomas cup cakes, and added a special picture to his beloved scrapbook.  
  
Michael fished with Felix on the beach while making trains from the sands of the 90 Mile Beach.  
  
Zucchini and Gus hooned around the bloke filling their nose with the smells of Lake Tyres.
