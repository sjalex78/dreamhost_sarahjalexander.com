We arrive at Sylwia and Lech's home for a family dinner of fish and vegetables as is tradition for Good Friday. The warmth of company and the comfort of familiarity embodies us all. Ambrose is cared for by Sylwia with pure grandmotherly love while Michael and I enjoy our meal. Felix and Matilda draw, read and play happily throughout the afternoon. With only hours of light left for the day we head to Wattle Park for a dusk walk joined by Lech and then head home. Saturday morning eggs are boiling with onion and the assortment of meats salt flowers bread a lamb and eggs are collected for our basket. After we all assemble the basket we head to Oakleigh Church to have it blessed. A stream of people are arriving and departing from the church clutching their basket. Huge matcho men hold petit delicate baskets, children proudly place their baskets at the alter, one basket even has a bottle of vodka. After the blessing we flow from the church and say a few hellos and head for an afternoon of catch up with old friends.  
  
A fire burns brightly at the front of StBenedicts Church. Felix and Matilda hold unlighted candles anticipating their lighting. We parade into the church and enjoy hours of candle light singing and readings. Felix, Matilda and Ambrose sleep soundly in the car all the way home.  
  
Sunday morning starts with panic. Michael yells "I can see Easter eggs on the rock". Matilda and Felix jump from their beds and run out into the garden. Eggs are everywhere.Felix and Matilda walk together holding their basket. Felix is quick to run and grab the more obvious eggs while Tilda is a little more pacient to collect eggs over looked by Felix. After the egg hunt Felix and Matilda sit together to divi up the loot without any parental direction. This process is wonderfully smooth and fair much to Michael and my delight.  
  
We travel to Mt.Martha to spend a wonderful day with my parents and grandparents. The Easter bunny had also dropped a few eggs at my parents farm. Our day is filled with much food, easy flowing conversation and four generations of knitting. Michael is taught to knit by my grandmother while Felix knits happily with my mother.  
  
Easter Monday is wet with Smingle Dingles. Felix and Michael hunt down my father who asks them with a smile to take that tradition back to Poland! after a gayful breakfast we head to Cape Shank for a 6km walk to and from Bushranger Bay. Felix and Matilda walked so well. Heading home Michael and I chatted about our next day walk, hike and Easter for the next year.......
