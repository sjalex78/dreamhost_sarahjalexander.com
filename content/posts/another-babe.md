Last week I got the privilege of holding my meeting my brother's newly arrived daughter. I managed to pop down to see them by myself as taking my family can be very busy especially for a new baby.  
  
 I checked and re check a number of times with my brother to see it it was ok? I had flash backs to an experience 2.5 years ago after the birth of my forth were we were visited by an individual who insisted that they have the right to come and visit even though it was a completely inappropriate time and dynamic for the family. Needless to say I have had to distanced myself (the first time ever)  from this person as their presence in my life is toxic and very hurtful. So with this in mind I wanted to visit without being the focus and ensured the mother, baby and father were comfortable with the visit.  
  
As I entered the room I buzzed with joy. My brother and his partner were peacefully sitting chatting while their bundle lay sleeping. My love was instant. Not the same intensity as I had experienced at the births of my own children but certainly I felt the warm an aunty feels. I had felt this instinctual bond at the birth of their eldest daughter but with the physical distance I needed to fall in love from afar via still pictures, skype and phone calls.  
  
Here and now I could inhale her newness, snuggle and hold her while her parents trusted me and were comfortable. I am so happy to be an aunty once again and consider the daughters of my brother as my children who I get to enjoy and give back to my brother and his partner- particularly when there is a messy nappy!
