I have found my love for my 7 1/2 month Ambrose swelling. Big kids are great but I need to work harder to connect and draw them in. One on one so important and I need to find more time for myself and with each of my children. Matilda love to swim and Felix loves to have first born time. Time for me to direct this attention as the child use negative activity to seek their needs.
