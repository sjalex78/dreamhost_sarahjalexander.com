The doors open and children rush through the doors. A space filled with wonderful activities, a marble race, a cubby, sewing, painting and story constructed from blocks, cloth and small wooden animal. Felix forgets I exists. He is busy. Ready. I kiss him goodbye- he doesn't even follow my path to the door. I pang of sadness fills my heart for a moment. This is yet another step I will take as my baby grows into childhood.
