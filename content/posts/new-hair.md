Matilda has got a new hair style are visiting a "real" hairdresser. She almost fell asleep as they washed her hair and she thoroughly loved and soaked up the experience of it all. She is very happy with her hair cut and was dissapointed t hear that we will not visit next week but rather in a couple of months. After some deep thought she ask, "Mamma my hair is too short, can we go the hairdresser to cut it longer?"
