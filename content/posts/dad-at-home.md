Dad has come over to stay for a couple of days. For Felix this is really the bomb. Dzia dzia (grand pa) this and that. He went to the extent of baricading the bedroom of Grand dad with blankets and a pusher the other day just to makesure that he does not go away. At dinner he is quite happy to give away the prime chair reserved for Mama to Dzia dzia. Dzia dzia is the favourite for  
reading books and the first to be called to the train station once the wooden tracks have been set up on the living room floor. I am a little worried that he will find it hard when Grand pa Lech does decide to go home.  
  
Yesterday we went to mass. Not having been for a while it was interesting to watch how Felix started to pick out words from the gospel, fish and snake, if you ask of your father of fish you do not expect him to give you a snake. Grandpa jokes that in Aboriginal culture the snake may be preferred.  
  
The other day, Grandpa had a little accident with his tubes and bags. He has a catheter in after his operation, and as he was changing the drainage bag he had a few drops drip on the carpet. For me it was same old same old, a bit of bicard and it will be right. Felix asked what I was doing, he seems to be at that age where he wants to find out everything. I said that just like Gus having accidents on the carpet and just like Felix has accidents, Felix finished of "yeah Dzia dzia turn for accident".  
  
Matilda falls under the radar a little mainly becasue most of her actions are so hard to verbalise, it is not like she is saying much comprehensible but she is a character. Although she has not started to stand unassisted, nor has she really thought about walking, I think she is almost certainly ready for both. Instead she has started to persue climbing. This is where she is just so  
different to Felix. She often wakes up in a very happy mood, once she has seen one of us, were as Felix was always very precious and needed lots of hugs. Felix probably never bit, were as she has killed half the card board books and a set of plastic cutlery with her teeth already. So to Felix never got into climbing while I am thinking about bolting the book cases to the wall in case she decides to give them a go. This would be most terrifying for Sarah who would be limited  
in which furniture would remain movable.  
  
For those looking to the continuation of the the craft series, it is going a little slow, at least in the blogging side. I plan to include some oragami pigs and Felix drawings of big trucks and trains as soon as I take some pictures and get into the spirit.
