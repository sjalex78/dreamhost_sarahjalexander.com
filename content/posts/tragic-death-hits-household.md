Matilda and Felix were heart broken and openly cried about the situation. Being a guinea pig with a particularly fun character, Charotte was very vocal and loved to "popcorn" around. Michael dug a grave in the front garden and we took it in turns saying some last goodbye messages and lay her to rest with a stick of celery and a carrot.](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_i63U3ulGoC4/TNZcrGj34DI/AAAAAAAAAHY/fQBfkyWoGa8/s1600/IMG_0326.jpg)  
"my heart is broken and is hurting so much"  
Felix cried.  
  
Matilda woke this morning to crying "I want to hold my guinea"  
  
Children show such raw emotion and I am proud that they express their sorrow so openly.  
  
Thank you Charlotte fo being a faithful, fun-filled and loving friend to Matilda.
