After reading that some children remember aspects of being born reportedly up to the age of seven I decided to ask Felix what it was like for him. Here are a few things he said..  
  
"It was tight and a short tunnel I needed to go through"  
"When I came out I just wanted my mamma and call for her mamma mamma"  
"it was warm inside"  
  
I might ask him again another time before his memories disappear.
