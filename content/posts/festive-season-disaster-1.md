"Mama I have made a huge mistake" Matilda sadly said and started to sob  

  

"Oh no what is it?! I asked trying to console her 

  

"Well...." she breaths deeply " i started to draw a donkey he was red and before I realised it he turned into a blue dragon." 

  

"Do you need new piece of paper?" I responded seriously without laughing out loud 

  

"Yes" she said with a small smile. We hug and head off to get a new piece of paper. 

  

  

These are moments when I know that being a parent is the best thing to do in this universe for me. I love you Tilda and your blue dragon dramas.
