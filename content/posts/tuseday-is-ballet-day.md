The other day it was me unblocking one of dads bags and tubes with a hesitant breath followed by a mouth wash, today it was Matilda's turn. Oh well what does not kill you only makes you stronger.  
  
Felix is getting into a bit of ballet. This morning it was tutu and ballet shoes, a wand with a ribbon on the end, and wild pirouets that end in his head comming closely to hitting something like the piano, a chair or a door frame. Even I put my ballet shoes on to try and encourage some jumps, kicks and toe points.
