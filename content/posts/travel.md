THere are plans brewing in our home and what I look forward most to is decluttering our lives in preparation. It is cleansing to clear away the excess in ones life and strip back to the basics. What is a little more difficult is trying to get 5 and 7 year olds to understand this notion but the process will be a great lesson for them both. The baby on the otherhand is happy to play with the crockery and cultery and will know no difference. After the start of clutter clearing we will be investigating new schools for the children and homes in new cities.........
