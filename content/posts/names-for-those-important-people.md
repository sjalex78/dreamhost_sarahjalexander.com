I love the budding of language you witness with a toddler. Gracie is almost 2 and is talking in sentences and using the names of her siblings and cousin Sophie with various success;  
  
**Ambrose** is AMEE with an occasional B slipped in. Gracie is particularly in love with Amby  and as they are playmates and needing to communicate is essential to the smooth transition of objects of interest.  
  
**Matilda** is TILDY and this acquisition has been very very competitive (in the eyes of her sister). Matilda has been caught privately schooling her when no one is looking! Matilda had hoped to be the first name but as Mama and Tata sneaked typically into spot 1 &2 and BABA and DjaDja into 3&4 it was time to get this toddler to say a sibling name. Matilda could accept Ambrose would be said first but there was no leaving it to chance if the next name was Matilda or Felix- the race was on. persistence and competition has won out!  
  
**Felix** is still yet to develop! A hard name for a toddler that even for Felix even took 3 years to say. Even without a name Gracie is able  to communicate very clearly her love excitement and admiration for the BIG BIG brother which is equality reciprocated!  
  
**Sophie** is DODO. This is the most entertaining rendition for a name so far. After having recently spent four days away with her cousin who lavishes love attention and yet does not bid for parental resource at home. A cousin relationship is like all the best bits of a sibling relationship! Gracie will see pictures of Sophie on my phone or on the wall near the dining table and announce with gusto DODO!
