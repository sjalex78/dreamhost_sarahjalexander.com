We travelled to our beloved Collingwood Children's Farm to our delight the paddocks are filled with kids (baby goats). Felix feeds them confidently as Tilda watches on a little unsure. We visit the pig pen to be greeted by a large pig rooting around in the mud. We offer a apple core which is greedly munch and swallowed. Sitting under a large tree we enjoy our popcorn, homemade yogurt and rice cakes as well as the company of a goose, a cat and a chook. We finish the morning sitting for 30 minutes cuddling Guine pigs.
