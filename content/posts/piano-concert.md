"Rain drops on roses and whiskers on kittens" Felix effortlessly sing while playing on the piano. Completely comfortable in front of the 60 people at the piano concert Felix enjoys the spot light. Matilda watches on and begs that she too can start learning piano, which I agree she need to do. I wish I had done music as early as Felix (& Matilda) have. Ambrose coos and listen attentively to the music.
