or is that happy windsday piglet. Felix has discovered the amazing world of Christopher Robin. Only 3 weeks post his 3rd birthday the "new" toys have almost been discarded and the old favourites are out again. We play the Winnie the Pooh story over and over again. In between Chapters we are baking a yummy carrot Cake for Matilda's birthday. I have a bliss filled house. My baby(Matilda) is getting better from her first illness in her life, the sun is shinning- I can plan those tomatoes soon and Felix and I are in the same vibe. Hey it Matilda's first birthday tomorrow- better finish writing her birth story. Happy cakeday Tigger!  
  
30 mins later.............  
I put one child to sleep while the other eats a small version of the birthday cake. After coming back from lying with Matilda (approx 5 minutes)... The Big Birthday cake has been sliced Felix announces! Wow Felix that's great!
