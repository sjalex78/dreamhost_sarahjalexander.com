We had just finished assembling the new tepee. Felix was impressed and decided everything from the play room needed to be in the tepee. He raced to the play room grabbed a box and walked back and forth transporting everything he could possibly find. Michal and I laughed and remarked that he was such a hoarder. "Yes" Felix said with a huge smile "I am a Horner" and he continued dragging in more treasures from the play room to the tepee.
