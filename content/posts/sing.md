If you asked me 12 months ago which of my children could sing I would instantly respond that only Felix could. While Matilda would belt out the words it was flat loud and hard to listen too. Give a child 12 months of prep with a musician as their teacher and a Steiner framework where children sing to transition and guess what...... they learn to sing. Matilda auditioned for the Australian Children Choir and will be singing next year so I am happy to say we are a singing home and household. !
