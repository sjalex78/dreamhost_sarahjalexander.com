On the day I was due (30/7/06) with my second child I waddled off to the acupunturest/ naturopath to start the "induction" processes. I had come so close to being induced with Felix, 2 years prior, that I was taking any chances. My naturopath Chris was great. It was almost relaxing having some fine needles placed into key pressure points around my body. He also prescribed some homeopaths to take if contractions began to help to strengthen them. That night I had some mild contractions but they disapated by morning. Unlike my first pregnancy, I was unable to rest much while running around with 2 year old Felix. To my surprise I had managed to continue to breastfeed throughout the pregnancy. He was having very short feeds and was getting colostrum. I was looking forward to seeing Felix's response to my milk flow when the baby arrived. Each night after my accupunture I got contractions but only a few- each time they started I would get out of bed- unable to sleep for a couple of hours. By the time I was 9 days over due you can imagine I was very tired.  
  
I was preparing breakfast- It is Sunday morning. 8:39am I get a sharp but short contraction- ooohh I remember this pain. The contractions I had been having during the evenings were definately pre-labour- this contraction hurt 8:51am another short and sharp contraction- wow this seems fast only 12 mins apart but it was only 10 sec long. These regular short sharp contractions continue for the next 2 or so hours until 11:30am. I took the dogs, Michael and Felix for a walk and still 10 sec contractions 10 minutes apart. I called the birthing centre- so say I would call them when we wanted to come in.  
  
I called Mum- and asked her to come and spend the rest of the day and night with us- just in case we needed to go to hospital- but I was sure we would be in for a long night!  
  
They continue to be very regular but so short. Mum arrived and we had dinner. Michael took Felix for a walk and they pop off to bed at 8pm. I am in for a busy night so I watch some TV, try to relax. Mum and I have wonderful chats till 10pm. I sat on gym ball and rolled my way through the pain. Just after 10 Mum decided to go to sleep. I can't sleep. I have a few contractions by myself and get a little worried. I don't want to be alone. I want someone to talk too. I want to hold someones hand.  
  
I try to get my husband up- man he is a heavy sleeper. I get him up and Mum too and decide to have a bath. I hop in the bath and in minutes don't want to be in there. We ring the hospital- they say it is up to me. I love the birth centre but hate them at the same time. I want to know when it is time to leave.  
  
Michael and I decided to go- even to just have a check up. My contrations are still 10 sec long 10 minutes apart. I start to get emotional and worry I might never see Felix again. I get mum to promise that she will look after him. I can't decide- Mum and Michael say to go I 'm not sure. We leave home at 23.30. The car trip was fine- we chatted the entire trip- still 10 sec contractions but now 25 min apart- this might be on all night- when will the contrations get longer I kept thinking?  
  
We arrive at the Hospital at 23:50. I feel right- I can have my baby here- I think to myself. 5 contractions and 5 minutes later we arrive at Room 2 at Birthing centre. I announce I need to go to the toilet. Later my midwife said she thought I was in transition when I so boldly announced my requirements. She was right.  
  
It is midnight. Michael goes back to car to get our suitcase and check me in. I try to lye on my back to have some monitoring done. I can can't lye still. I keep jumping to my feet and moving moving moving.  
12:05 My midwife suggests I take my pants off. I take all my clothes off and lean over the bed. Michael arrives back in our room. He is taken back- "why is Sarah naked? It is a bit early for that isn't it?"12:08 I let go and push. My birth plan had expressed that I wanted to guild my baby out myself but when asked I say I don't want to. 2 contractions and 2 minutes after beginning to push the waters break and my babies head is out.  
12:10 My baby starts talking to me and 2 minutes later at 12:12 on 28th August 2006 my beloved daughter Matilda Jane Milewska is born.  
  
My second natural birth- this time without any gas. The love you feel throughout your body is amazing after a natural birth. Oxytocin pumps through your body at the level you will ever experience- thankfully I could feel it from head to toe. Oxytocin is the love hormone and suffice to say I feel in love with my daughter the moment I heard her talk. I love you Matilda. Happy Birthday.
