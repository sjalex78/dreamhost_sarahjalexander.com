Even with kids. In fact by it's very nature taking a bus creates a relaxing atmosphere fir children. They can choose where they sit, fall asleep in a pusher and they can both window seats on the same side. As a parent I can look out the window with my children. The key to enjoying ride a bus is timing never run late for a bus and expect a toddler to not have a tantrum at the same time.
