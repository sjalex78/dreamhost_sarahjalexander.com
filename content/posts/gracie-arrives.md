My estimated dues date arrives and I am hopeful that I will launch into labour, but deep down in my heart I know it won't be that day. The preceding weeks are filled with night of broken sleep, crazy rants, mad cleaning and a touch of nerves. Part of me wants to hide away from the world while other parts of me want to get closer to people. I play the homebirth scene over in my mind thinking how the children will be there and my mum and my cousin. Too many people??  I feel confident that I will be labouring at home but flexible to follow the leadership of my midwifes.  
  
I am surprised that I feel "in love' with my midwives in the final weeks of the pregnancy and feel so happy and connected every visit they make to me. I have a list of things to do and I decide on Thursday 17th October (40+5) I will get that list done. Thursday's are my Amby free day (and night) and on this occasion I mentioned to my parents-in-law that maybe Amby could come home tonight as I wanted him close by. I completed my list (toy library returns, lunch with Michael, photocopy and send documents for various things, library books back) collected the kids from school and settled into a normal Thursday night.  
  
At midnight (18th October) I woke up unsettled and unable to get comfortable. I listened to music quietly in the dark sleeping next to my husband and children. I must have feel asleep but was woken at 4am with a contraction. Unlike the nights previous this was not simply gas or pressure from lying too long in one spot, and turned on and off rhythmically. I smiled. I was happy and wanted this sensation to stay. I lay for an hour before waking Michael to tell him we were going to have our baby. That hour was lovely as it was just me and the baby, in our dark quiet house getting ready for our day.  
  
Michael got our space ready for birth, while I communicate with my mum, midwife and cousin. It was lovely to write the text "I'm having a baby today". Matilda woke up so early and must have know something was happening. She lay next to me on the couch and watched, listened and smiled. My cousin Anna arrive glowing with excitement and ready to record our final birth yet first homebirth.  

  

 I wanted to walk and 6am is a lovely time to do it. Michael and I walked down by the creek and the walking intensified and  regulated the contractions. "Yes hello I want this" I would talk through my contractions. I leaned on Michael and practiced groaning deep into my body visualising my cervix opening.  
  
Ambrose was awake when we returned and he and Michael made coffee got breakfast ready. Between contractions we talked laughed and spoke about names for the baby. I lay on the couch and contractions were mild and very irregular.  
  
My midwife Kellly arrived (8:30am) equipped with the extra "stuff" hopefully not needed but alway good to have on hand. Ambrose told her to "go away" and used the Swiss ball to block her entrance. Kelly sweetly and calming agreed and waited. We eventually talked him into helping to put the birth pool linner into the pool. Felix woke up hearing Amby and laughed with such joy to hear I was in labour (and that he wasn't going to school). 

  

Kelly and I chatted and for the entire time 45mins I did not have a contraction. This made me worry I might pop in and out of labour but I was assured that this was very common and nothing to worry about. Kelly headed off and I resumed my irregular and mild contractions.  
  
My mother arrived (10am) and was ready for action. She took the children to a local park to burn off their energy and excitement as we were assuming a long day and night and for the baby to arrive late Friday night or early Saturday morning.  
  
I heard an unexpected knock on the door (10:45) after a contraction which had a bit of bite and casually answered the door. Kris, a midwife I had not meet, was popping in to introduce herself as she was my backup midwife if Jan or Kelly couldn't get there. Kris and I instantly hit it off and chatted like old friends. We parted assuming we might not see one another again.  
  
For the next three hours my contractions were irregular but getting more painful. I would lean on the couch on the Swiss ball and on Michael. Deep and rhythmic moans helped me to channel my energy and distract my mind from the pain. Reassuring words for Michael were invaluable. I sent a message followed by a call to the midwives at 2pm as the contractions "were starting to hurt" and I should have my penicillin in the next few hours. But I was very happy to be we're I was and with just Michael as support for a while longer. 

  

The children were happy to play in the sunshine, visit the park , draw, cuddle guinea pigs, bid on eBay with Mum, visit the neighbours and periodically checked what I was doing. Ambrose would feedme, say sorry and pat my back I had a contraction when he was in the room. Felix would rub my back and Matilda would hold my hand and both would just watch, listen and smile.  
  
My sister in law and niece arrived to have a play. I loved to see them and it felt wonderful they could casually be there.  
Dinner plans were discussed and mum, Kasia and the children headed out to get "fish n chips". The best day according to Felix cause we get take away for dinner. 

  

4:30 We received a call from Kris to say she was on her way but stuck in awful traffic. At this point my contractions were spacing 3-5 minutes apart and really starting to bite. I wanted to get into water but irrationally worried that this might stop it all. 

  

A blurry half an hour (4:30-5)of intense contractions. I needed to stand and hold into Michael to ride the pain and closed my eyes and heading into a deep meditation between contractions. This state was continued until our baby was born. So much of what I said and did is from what my cousin and Michael recalled. 

  

At 5pm both Kris and Jelly arrived and upon hearing my contractions said my baby was coming. I told them it wasn't coming till midnight. My canular was inserted and a loading dose of penicillin injected. 

  

I became desperate to get comfortable and wanted the water.  The pool was filled with hot water. I stripped off my clothes and stepped into the pool at 5:30pm. The relief of pressure was incredible. I shut my eyes and deeply meditated thinking of nothing but the warmth and sensation of the water. I started to get worried the children would miss it all. Matilda had returned with Mum and dinner. The boys had gone to the park with Kasia. 

  

My transition started with me crying for my boys I was so worried they would miss the birth. Kelly asked Michael to call Kasia and ask her to bring Felix and Ambrise home as I was apparently stopping myself from pushing and becoming distressed about them not being there. 

  
Soon the boys returned. Michael and the children created a circle around me. I gazed lovingly into Ambrose's eyes "you need me?" Amby would nod reassuringly. I loved them all so much in those moments. 

  

At 6:10 I needed to push. It builds slowly and your control to stop it fades. At the next contractions I push, the waters pop and a head is out. I am asked to stop and wait but I need the body out the stretch is intense and I lull back into a quiet space and the next contraction our baby is passed through my legs underwater and I bring baby up into my chest at 6:15pm. 

  

I am suddenly aware of my surrounds with ten smiling faces standing around the birth pool and little hands touching the baby.

We ask Matilda to see if its a girl or boy. She looks and quiet says almost in disbelief  " it's a girl" and the room is filled with laughter and bright smiles. 

  

Grace Alexandra is here with us all.
