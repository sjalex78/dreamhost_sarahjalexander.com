I honestly can't remember much of December 2011 and it was even a quiet one! Finally we have stopped and no better place than by the beach at Lake Tyres. It takes us all a few days to finally stay in our PJ till 1pm but finally today we do. The big kids have extended their adventure boundaries to include the beach by themselves although the water is still off limits. The baby now 9 1/2 months enjoys exploring the house, verandas and grass near the house. The local wombat has excavated a new hole under the shed and we wait at dusk to meet her in person. A few more days left to gel together as a family before heading back to the city to enjoy the long summer days of catching up with friends and exploring the city. Although there at many highlights such as the birth of Ambrose it has been a busy year and I look forward to leaving 2011 behind and enjoying 2012.
