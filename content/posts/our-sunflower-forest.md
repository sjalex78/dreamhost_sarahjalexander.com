Felix and I have bee doing our "first" garden project together. We planted some sunflowers (Giant Russian) a couple of weeks ago in jiffy pots. Today we transplanted then out to the backyard to hopefully create a sunflower forest near the sandpit. Felix has his own watering can which he excitedly filled up from our small water tank.
