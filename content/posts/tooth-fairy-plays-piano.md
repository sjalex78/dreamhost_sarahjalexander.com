Felix list his first tooth a fortnight ago. He is very young to be already having wobbly teeth and the tooth fairy visiting. According to the Steiner phylosophy the loss if teeth symbolizes a childs readiness for academic focus but this usually occurs around 7 years of age. With 2 years until he will formally learn to read a write we have decided that his musical and artistic intellegences can be norished. We have met with a Suzuki piano teacher and over the next month felix (&matilda) will start lessons. The Suzuki method has some methodology which aligns well with our family. It allows children to be children. And is developed for children.
