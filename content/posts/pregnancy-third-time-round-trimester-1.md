Our first planned pregnancy! Although I thought it might take a little longer as I am now in my thirties! I was convinced that I would continue my canoe polo and netball until well into the second trimester- my body has had other ideas! Bang on 6 weeks the grumbling of nausia started to take hold a gradual build up till week 9 when I begging my GP for something to just give me a moment of feeling normal rather than the constant feeling of nausia. I have tried everything: Ginger in every available form: capsule, raw, cooked, beer, tea: NOTHING! Even the medication for my GP does nothing. I now sleep 10-12 hours every night and love to have a 2-3 hour sleep in the daytime if possible! So this trimester has plagued me somewhat as I ignore everyone I live with and barely make it through a day at work: my poor husband and children :(  
  
I look forward to not feeling this sickness hopefully soon as this feeling should go away at the 3 month mark! What I am finding the most difficult is that I am whingeing about how I feel- I just want to stop feeling this way come on body!
