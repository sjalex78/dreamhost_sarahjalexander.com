We have enjoyed collecting a number of items on our holidays. The beach had provided wonderful natural items such as shells, driftwood, stones and sponges. The bush block we are staying in provides wild flowers, doddervine, banksia nuts and leaves. While the local oppshops provide silk, rope and dress ups. We have come here for 10 days with no toys and yet the hours of play generated from the items collected has been amazing. Children don't need toys just time space and wonderful imagination.
