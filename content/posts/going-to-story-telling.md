Whenever Felix is entertaining himself it is an opportunity to catch up with something like cooking or cleaning around the hose or simply relaxing. The midday sleep would have to be the gold mine for this especially when Sarah is home alone. And so it was on this day. She finaly did start to hear some voices from the living room where Felix was sleeping. At first she thought that she had left the radio on for the duration of the sleep. She went to the door leading into the room. A truly beautiful sight awaited her. It was Felix, on his toddler couch where he was laid to sleep, lying and talking to a doll. Probably telling her about all the fantastic dreams he had.

  

Later that day they went to story telling at the local library. For over 20 minutes Felix sat there mistified. Other kids partook in the hand actions as encouraged by the story teller but Felix just sat, watched and listened. I have no doubt that he was taking it in and learning what story time in this new place was. He shows such determination and genuine interest. It is inspiring to try to be so involved in everything we do as he is in what he does.

  

Finaly the kids were to get some glitter put on their pieces of paper. Sarah just said what she wanted him to do, "Felix, go over to the lady to get glitter put on your card" He immediately took that as a command and procedded with his card to the lady. It seems that informing him of everything we do and want him to do is paying off and he is clearly understanding sentences.
