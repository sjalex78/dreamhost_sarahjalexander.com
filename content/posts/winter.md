Winter brings to our household a time to slow down. We are all sleeping longer overnight and relish warm cuddles in bed come morning. Ambrose is only 3 months and it lovely to snuggle with a baby in bed to keep warm. Matilda and Felix long for winter as they are winter babies who celebrate their birthdays in August. Our seasonal table reflects the cool and refreshing whites of winter. The garden is now sown with bulbs which have slowly pocked up through the garden beds. The leaves of the large trees surrounding our home are falling thick and fast and the crisp winter light fills the backyard and streams into our windows. The chickens are moulting and have fresh plumage pushing through while egg production slows. The soil is cool and my gardening urges are held back waiting for spring.
