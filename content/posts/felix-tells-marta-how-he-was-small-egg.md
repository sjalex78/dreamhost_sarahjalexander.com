Tonight we caught up with old friends Marta and Peter for dinner. We enjoyed a wonderful summer evening at their garden 10 km from the centre of Warsaw. They have a block of land covered in fruit trees including a divine cherry trees complete with ripe plump juicy (YUMMY) cherries! Over the course of a picnic dinner conversation flowed as did the lovely white wine. From out at left field, in a matter of fact way, Felix described to Marta how he was an a very little egg before he was a boy. This egg grew into a baby in "Mama's" tummy and he popped out as a baby. I wish it had been that simple.
