I continue to be a nightmare to live with. For 4 years my bodies hormone swing has been a trial for all. I have however enjoyed having only 4 periods in 4 years. The two pregnancies and ongoing lactation have been difficult emotionally but nothing compared to the monthly fertile hormone cycle- which has just returned. I am tempted to just get pregnant again- yet the thought of pregnancy does not appeal. At least excercise curbs my frustration and makes me easier to live with.
