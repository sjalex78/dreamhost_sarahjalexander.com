A pregnancy will take a toll on your body. I have gain weight 20kg, lost muscle tone and acquired new aches and pains (but undoubtedly it is totally worth it).  
A bout of mastitis knocked me around for a day and I continue to bleed and may need an ultrasound later in the week to investigate the cause.  
My osteopath has prescribed some stretching and light walking till my 6 week appointment. After this time we decided that cycling and paddling were best low impact sports to see me out for the year. I will return to canoe polo after Easter and hit a spinning class or two as well as try the road bike. I feel a little nervous but will be happy to be exercising again.
