Our last transfer onto a plane bound for London. Another hour of navigating another airport. In this case we have our boarding passes. Our only delay is a long delay on the queue checking luggage. My laptop gets a thorough rub down with a little paper patch that has a small, coin sized, circular wire in it. Presumably some kind of antenna. The guard asks me for my boarding pass and disappears with it for 5 minutes. We are running out of time to get to our flight but what can I do? Guard comes back and confirms that everything is OK.  
  
We are the last to board the plane. We finally get a window seat. After 24 hours of travel, the kids start to loose it. Felix is upset with the window seat, with how many horse stickers he has in his scrap book, with the taste of the complimentary chocolates. We rearrange seating position between us 5 times including once on the run way. 1 hour and 20 minutes later we will be in London
