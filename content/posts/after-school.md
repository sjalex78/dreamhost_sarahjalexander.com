We are home from school. Felix and I enjoyed a spring afternoon riding along the Yarra River from school to home. We arrive and Felix annoces he needs some toast and like an expert gets the bread into the toaster. He is so excited when it pops and quickly butters and spreads vegemite on one and honey on the other. I smile as I hear the munching tune which means I am happy coming fom Felix as he sits at the table tucking into his afternoon tea. I think he might be ready to be a big brother again :)
