Michael and I arrange a babysitter so we can attend Matilda's first school interview. I have two concerns I want to address..... I know nothing of Matilda's feelings about how school is going or if she has made any friends. Matilda's teacher answers these questions witching moments of our interview. The next 15 minutes is a casual discussion of the prep program. As we ride to the pub for the remaining time we have together I feel so happy and confident with our kids school that I feel like I am flying and that Matilda's silence is affirmation of being in right place.
