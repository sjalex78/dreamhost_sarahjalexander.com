Â My life is definitely attuned to that of a wave. Ups downs and flats. I want to spend quality time with each of children, be an amazing mother aunt daughter granddaughter and wife, get cracking professionally and there is this amazing list I dare not mention. It's wonderful, emotional, tiring like today after a low wave of work challenges all day my day became bright and high waved with the giggle from a baby, joke from my blond lovely, smile and chat with my big girl, bike ride with my big boy and lovely chats with my best friend. I am reminding myself lately of the challenging year we had last year and see on the horizon such amazing adventures to be had.
