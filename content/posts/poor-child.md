A child sits and loving draws a picture for another child. It is simple, not perfect yet there is an image recognisable if you are able to use your imagination and listen to the story connected with the image. A heart breaks when the child who this image is created for want to destroy it and says it is yucky. How can a preschooler know how to destroy art and contain this nasty reaction? Is it humanly possible that they have grown up to only know that perfection and winning is about all else? Poor child so closed so early in life.
