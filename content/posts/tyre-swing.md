My vivid memories off sitting on my tyre swing under a big old oak tree are reignited. I witness a young boy swinging on his tyre swing under a big old apple tree. Is he day dreaming, enjoying the gentle rocking motion, the smell of summer, the solitude? To see a child enjoy the same types of moments as you remember doing yourself brings joy from deep within, a feeling of knowing and kinship.
