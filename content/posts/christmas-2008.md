We spent almost 24 hours celebrating Christmas. Starting at the 5:30 church service on Christmas eve in Nerrium East and ending with a skype call to Poland at 5:30 on Christmas day. Felix was particularly excited and overwelmed by it all. Matilda was generally more interested in eating chocolate than unwrapping gifts. Some highlights included: Felix and cousin Sabina running outside to see Santa disapearing towards the setting sun, Matilda meeting a life sized Chloe (doll) from great-grandmother Winty with such gentleness and affection, Felix wanting to show everyone his remote controlled car from Chris. Felix managed to keep all his gifts to other people a surprise and seemed to enjoy giving as much as receiving. Merry Christmas.
