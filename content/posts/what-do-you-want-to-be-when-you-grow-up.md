Felix, Matilda and I like to discuss what we want to be when we grow up. Felix currently wants to be an inventor and teacher. 4 days inventing and 3 days teaching!  
Matilda loves band aids blood and dead animals and has decided that she wants to be a doctor. I mean while think I might not be a teacher for ever and might be a midwife or gardener or both ;)
