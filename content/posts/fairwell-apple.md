Aaaahh a chook has made me sob, laugh and has helped me to convince Michael that chickens are a good addition to our family. Apple defied death 2 years ago when she ripped her crest off and underwent surgery to stick it back on. She also stood her ground when bailed up by the dogs in the backyard at Chadstone by jumping at Zucchini she saved herself. Apple would come to the window to say hello when ever free ranging the backyard. She would also peck at any pesky noses hunting her through the chicken wire and reminder a pointer or two that she owned this bit of the yard. Thanks for the eggs! Thanks for the laughs. Sorry we couldn't help you get better. Enjoy the fields of Narnia where I imagine that there are tonnes of you favourite food.....
