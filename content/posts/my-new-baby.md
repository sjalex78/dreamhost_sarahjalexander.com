Did you get excited? Felix and Matilda are so in love with Sophie- me too!. We have been visiting a park each day between the rain. One park we have found has it's own toddler pool- Matilda took a dive the first day and now steers clear of it. Chris, Kasia, Michael and I have been playing cards each night after the kids have gone to sleep- it is all very competitive- Kasia has been victorious outright so far- it seems to be going to her head :)
