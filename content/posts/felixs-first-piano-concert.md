Felix's first piano concert was held on Saturday. We heard Frère Jacques over and over and over again in preparation for his concert. I was a little worried as the practice session on the Monday prior was some what patchy. Felix was more interested in entertaining his audience with smiles and glances that he forgot to concentrate on his hands.  
  
Moments before he heading up to the piano for his performance he remarked  
  
"I'm nervous but it feels good"  
  
Felix did not look at his hands and managed to only make one small mistake. His timing was perfect and Frère Jacques sounded really good. He stood up and took a big bow and flashed a huge confident smile to the crowd. Aaaah the little entertainer in his element.
