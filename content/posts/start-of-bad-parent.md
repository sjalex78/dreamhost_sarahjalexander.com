So I have started to become a bad parent?! Tonight Felix is riding home form his dance class by himeself all of 1km from our home 3 roads to cross and all by himself, he is almost 8. I shudder when I hear parents tell their children about the dangers of being taken by the boogie man if they disapear around a corner and are out of sight. I also talk to my kids about people we see and meeting the street. It is important for children to no be scard of people as 99+% are wonderful people who are their to help not to "steal you". I want my children to trust their instinct and so I feel it important to not let them inherit my fears but rather my confidence in knowing I can help myself and understand how to get out of a trouble situation. So it is not like I am going to throw them in the deep end without knowing how to swim. I love the mother who [let her 9 year old ride the subway](http://freerangekids.wordpress.com/2008/04/06/why-i-let-my-9-year-old-ride-the-subway-alone/) in NY alone.  
  
  
  
So he made it home very excited that he had independently travelled home. How was it "I was a little nervous but super excited". The progression of letting go continues.......
