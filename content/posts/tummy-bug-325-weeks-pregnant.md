It is not a normal thing to be 32 weeks pregnant and really sick. Our poor baby lived through 24 hours of me vomitting. Each time the involuntary spasism emptied my stomach the baby kick and squirmed as if he/she wanted to escape. Too early baby I would say, you need a few more weeks to cook. I called the hospital and was told that if I did not hold down water for 24 hours ie vomitted one more time I would need to come in for an IV to rehydrate. I didn't panic but the idea of going to hospital certainly gave me a focus "not to vomitt". I have emerged this morning feeling better but now wiped out and very tired. The baby has settled down too- most likely exhused from all the wild sounds and sensations.
