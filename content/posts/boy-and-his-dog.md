A unsuspecting Felix lights up as Michael arrives. Quickly he realises that his best friend Gus is absent from the car. He wails. No eye contact for Michael, no hello, only a wail for Gusy- my friend Gusy. A promise of fishing silences the wail and dries the tears. If Gus is spoken about in conversation a scow will cross Felix's face.
