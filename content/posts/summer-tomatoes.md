Bright red delicious tomatoes are ready for picking in our garden. In my infinite wisdom I show Matilda the first ripe tomatoes for the season. It is quickly gobbled up. I notice 2 other in other part of the garden. A 5 minute phone call and I return to the children in the garden- The tomatoes are gone. Matilda plays happily with Felix in the sandpit.
