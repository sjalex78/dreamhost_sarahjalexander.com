After a day full of wind flurries and sudden showers that kept us indoors all of Sunday, it was time to get some fresh air before bed time. Matilda (almost 3) was on my back and Felix (just turned 5) was happy walking. As we entered the park the rain came again and we raced to the shelter in the darkness. We made it without getting too wet. We looked at large droplets of water pouring off the roof. I got my camera and tripod out and it was time to take some pictures. We started with some of each other and then some of the dripping rain but when the rain eased, we went out onto the grass in the dark and started to take photos of playing with torches.  
  
It was quite difficult to explain to Felix that the torch would have to point at the camera to get the effect we needed but positioned between 2 trees he at least understood where he must stand. I first took a standard exposure photo which gave us around 2 seconds of open aperture. I then went into a more manual mode and managed to get around 4 seconds. We tried with an LED torch and some torch application on the iPhone.

Obviously the effect is motion blur but what I did find interesting was the blue tinge in the light of the LED torch. I answered my wife knowingly that there are blue LED junctions or some sort to help product white light but it does not answer why the blue is so vivid in sections of the motion blur. I leave that as an un-answered observation and am happy for any comments.
