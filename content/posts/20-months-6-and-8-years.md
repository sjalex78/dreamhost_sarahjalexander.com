2012 is a dynamic year of change fir the Milander household. Ambrose has battled through the winter of toddlerhood with perpetual illness but seems to be emerging with a strong sense of self and determination (mother political term for strong willed and self centered) which is perfectly acceptable for a 2 yr old. Matilda has bloomed at school and has found a rhythm and home in her school group . We have been blessed to have a teacher of 30 plus years of teaching and a firm but warm practice to take Tilda for the next 5 years. I no longer worry about her place at school knowing that she will be understood respected nurtured challenged excited by primary school. She has found an assertion where she no longer feels she is little and that she can choose if a person is worthy of her friendship if they do show her respect or care where due, where previously she would feel sad or bad about herself if someone told her she was too young to play a game etc.  
Felix loves school, loves friends, loves people, loves his teacher, loves art, inventing, story, acting, singing. He seems to love life which is a joy for everyone who shares time with him. His greatest companion is Matilda and they will spend hours drawing playing creating together. A sense of playfulness is ripe when he interacts with Ambrose. 8 and 2 year olds can wrestle! Michael is our families rock. We all benefit from living with a man who works in his dream job and this has inspired me to follow my dream and to retrain as a landscape architect.  
  
2012 has been a busy year, a year if change, challenge, soul searching, relationship remodeling and growth. With five people there is a constant need to stop and check we are all having those emotional tanks filled and time for one another as well for the family friends and community that support, inspire and guide us
