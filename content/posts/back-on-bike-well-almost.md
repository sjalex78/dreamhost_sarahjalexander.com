I hesitate to announce that it might finally be over (shhh the morning sickness) but I have managed to ride Matilda to school and back today and yesterday road to work and back on a new "big belly bike". It is lovely to ride again- although I do miss the road riding which will have to wait until April or May 2011. I will hopefully keep on the bike till the end- just will see how the balance hold up. It is great timing with the spring weather- it was even fun riding in the warm rain this afternoon. SO watch out Melbourne pregnant women on bike heading your way soon- oh what a sight!
