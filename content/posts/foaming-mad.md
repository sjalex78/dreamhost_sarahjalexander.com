A children's day with the fire brigade and ambulance is exciting for all concerned and in more ways than one. We arrived at a yacht club in Włocławek to witness a fire fighter standing in the middle of a bonfire, fortunately he was clad in a "heat resistant suit" Hmmm not what I would expect at a children's day. Are the children of Włocławek mimicking this? Wrapped in foil and becoming baked potatoes?  
  
Next jets of water in an array of formations sprayed the crowd pulse after pulse. We laughed as people scuttled like ants to avoid getting wet. Finally, thinking the best has been, the fire fighters rolled out a tunnel and started to pump out foam, a fire retardant. They did not stop. In fact they removed the barriers to actively encourage people to get closer to the foam. The foam grew and grew and grew, Suddenly you could heard irate parents coincide with excited laughter and the foam was speckled with children.

Felix was gob-smacked, we all were. They continued to pump out foam which rapidly engulfed parked cars. After a time the foam was switch off, restocked with detergent and after a few moments started again. You don't have to understand a language to understand anger. I glanced to the fire fighter who had a mother screaming at him to stop as presumably her small child has somewhere under the foam. Cross parents marched smiling wet foam covered children to the car where they were vigorously undressed and bailed into immaculate cars. A universal thing I noticed as these reactions would also be present in an Australian crowd too. Like in Australia, the parents who laughed and tended to say ok to their children's desire to swim in the bubbles sat back relaxed and happy as they watched their children being children.  
  
Felix managed to strip, plunged into the foam announcing that it was snow, I wonder if he will take his clothes off the next time he sees snow at Mt. Hotham.
