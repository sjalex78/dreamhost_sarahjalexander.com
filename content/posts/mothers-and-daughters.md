I am blessed to have a daughter and are thankful everyday. The emotional waves of having a daughter can be full on as she is a real reflection of yourself, your own relationship with you mother and the strength of women that you are. Matilda and I clash, yell, bounce, glare, giggle, smile, laugh, roll eyes, sigh but under it all love each other very deeply. I love my sons as dearly but they will never really understand how it feels to be a women but my daughter will. I see my mother helping her mother, now in her 80's , return the love and compassion in caring for her as she becomes more frail. I was blessed to also see this 25 years ago when my great grandmother needed my grandmother for emotional support.
