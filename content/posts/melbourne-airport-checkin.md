It seems that Felix is not linked to the rest up us by his plane ticket. Sarah stood at check in for over 1 hour as the staff tried to work something out. This certainly did not sound like the perfect start to the trip. We had 2 transfers ahead of us and were not sure if we had spots on the plane let alone our luggage getting through. For the time being we got some boarding passes for all of us sitting next to each other to Hong Kong.
