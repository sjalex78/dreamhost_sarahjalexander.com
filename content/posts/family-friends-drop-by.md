A random phone call from Beata, "we are in Orbost, can we drop over?" 2 hours later we are beach combing being blown to pieces. Children don't notice and playfully splash in the waves. Time to go tears and cries of "please don't go" I assure Felix we will see them again and this reminds him to smile.
