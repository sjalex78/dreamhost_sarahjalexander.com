After a fortnight apart we (S,F,T) are so excited to finally meet Michael. We are aboard the train for Stanstead airport were we will fly to Marselle where Michael will meet us. I receive a text "I am in wrong airport". My heart sinks. I instantly ramp into solution mode and imagine me landing in France with the children, getting the hire can and driving to Nice (3 hours from Marselle) ALONE. ok I can do this this is what travel is all about. Moments later another text arrive "Flying :) call me". I can breath again and sit back and enjoy a moment of peace.
