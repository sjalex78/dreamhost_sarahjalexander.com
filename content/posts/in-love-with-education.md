I want my children to love learning. We have met both teachers and feel we have found co-parents, co-educators who we can work with to instill a passion for learning. Their rooms and gardens are magic. I want to be in prep and kinder again! A wonderland of discovery, nestled in the heart of the city where children can play, sing, climb, dance and be. My heart is warm, I see a wonderful start for Matilda and Felix. I feel so lucky and privileged as a parent to be able to send my children to such a wonderful place.
