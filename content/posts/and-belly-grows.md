\=At times I feel like this is my first pregnancy. Michael is constantly asked "did this happen last time?" "was I this big" did I sleep last time?". They say no two babies are the same as are my three pregnancies.  
THe differences:  

*   my belly dimensions I seem to be going out sidewards pregnancy 2/3 rather than outwards
*   no skin numbness pregnancy 3
*   sporatic tandam feeding pregnancy 3, full on breastfeeding pregnancy 2, no breastfeeding pregnancy 1
*   Pregnancy 3 colostrum at 32 weeks, others were well past 36 weeks
*   Its hot "i never want to be pregnant in summer again"

The similarities include:  

*   putting on weight I have hardly eaten and yet my baby is perfect at putting fat on my breasts, bottom and legs (thankfully I know that long term breastfeeding, bike riding and netball helps to reduce the fat post baby)
*   not sleeping and using the toilet 3-4 times a night
*   sore back
*   cramps in my legs
*   grumpiness
